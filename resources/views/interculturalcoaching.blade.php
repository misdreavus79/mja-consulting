	<h3>Benefits:</h3>
	<p>Coaching provides clients the opportunity to engage in active and on-going reflection and self-care to attain and maintain a quality of life they aspire to.</p>
	<p>Coaches help coachees see the bigger picture and the multiple paths one can take to get what it is they desire.</p>
	<p>Coaches help people identify gaps and risks they might not have otherwise known.</p>
	<p>Coaches help coachees explore possibilities that are realistic and solutions that are practical.</p>
	<p>Coaches help people to unleash hidden potential, creative energies, and a positive solution/results focused attitude that propels them into areas they might not have otherwise explored.</p>
	<p>Coaching fosters a co-active relationship that is balanced, focused, challenging, supportive, and motivating, ultimately leading to increased self-awareness, confidence, flexibility, pro-activity, a renewed sense of self and potential, and healthy relationships (personal and professional).</p>

	<h3>An interdisciplinary approaach:</h3>
	<p>Among the many theories and methods utilized by MJAMangual Learning Solutions, below are some of the areas we are most knowledgeable in:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Emotional Intelligence &amp; Diversity</li>
		<li>Appreciative Inquiry</li>
		<li>Interactive Strategies for Performance Improvement</li>
		<li>Experiential Education</li>
		<li>Complexity Theory</li>
		<li>Activity Theory</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Coaching fee</h3>
	<p>Because Coaching requires a shift in the Coachees habits, life direction, and mind frame this work is very intensive for both the Coach and Coachee.  The coaching process takes time and while each client is at different points in their life and the GAINS Insight™ process there is one thing that is quite certain – one month is not likely to move a person to the position in life they seek to be in.  Therefore, we ask a commitment from our clients of a minimum of three months.</p>

	<h3>Rates for One-on-One Coaching begin at $400 per month which include:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>4 telephone coaching sessions* (one session per week up to 60 min.) and </li>
		<li>Unlimited email communication.</li>
	</ul>

	<small>* One-on-One Coaching in-person can be arranged.  Please contact us for more details.</small>
