			<h3>Why the need for Intercultural Education Programs?</h3>
			<p>Education programs are at the core of what prepares our citizens to function in society. Vital in preparing people to function effectively and mindfully in an increasingly globalized world is developing intercultural relations skills: communication, sensitivity, and understanding. A combination of these skills and encouraging civic engagement can be quite powerful!</p>
		
			<p>Intercultural Synergy is committed to unleashing the power within young people and doing so through developing education programs that nurture self exploration, intercultural understanding, and the development of intercultural competence. </p>
		
			<p>Before expanding one's worldview, developing intercultural competence and effective citizenry, we must work on developing a foundation. It is essential in working with people that we focus on the person coming to terms with who they are and how they identify, as well as where they are in life. When the person realizes the complexity of their own identity and worldview, the space to introduce the complexity of the "cultural other" presents itself. Thus, allowing the individual to build their repertoire, expand their worldview, and prepare them to be interculturally sensitive and effective.</p>
