	<h3>Intercultural & Multicultural Teams</h3>
	<p>Now a days it is rare to find a homogeneous work team. More and more companies and rganizations are realizing the value of multicultural teams. While multicultural teams tend to generate more ideas and creative strategies/solutions, they can be quite challenging if not developed in intercultural sensitivity and competence.</p>

	<p>A challenge for homogenous groups is understanding and working effectively with others. Therefore, intercultural and multicultural training is necessary to begin to build a teamâ€™s knowledge, understanding & respect for one another, and skills around intercultural communication and competence.</p>

	<p>MJAMangual Learning Solutions works with organizations to assess their needs and develop a training program that will begin where people are, while both challenging and supporting them in moving to where they need to be in order to be effective.</p>
